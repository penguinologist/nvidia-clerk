# nvidia-clerk

This project was written in response to the recent NVIDIA RTX 3080 release debacle. During the launch multiple different groups of scalpers used
closed source "bots" to procure large quantities of NVIDIA GPU's and most consumers were left without being able to purchase the product. This 
project will provide a short term solution so that customers can ensure they can buy a GPU and compete with these scalpers.

NVIDIA Clerk doesn't actually purchase products for customers, it simply tracks the avaliable inventory from NVIDIAs APIs and automatically adds a GPU
to your checkout/cart and navigates your browser checkout page whenever they become avaliable. The clerk can also notify you of this process if you provide
Twilio API information (I am not interested in running an entire service for users, so this feature is limited to users aware of how to setup
such things).

## FAQ

#### `exec: "google-chrome": executable file not found in %PATH%`
The path to google chrome needs to be added to the path. While reinstalling Chrome can fix it, a quick search on Google will show you how to do exactly this.

#### My environment variables are being unset
You can add them to your .bashrc or .zsh files and be sure to export them. Sourcing the files and/or restarting your window will load them. That said, the easiest way to do this is just to wrap these values in a wrapper script. eg.

```
set TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID={YOUR_TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID}
set TWILIO_TOKEN={YOUR_TWILIO_TOKEN}
set TWILIO_SOURCE_NUMBER={YOUR_TWILIO_PHONE_NR}
set TWILIO_DESTINATION_NUMBER={THE_NUMBER_TO_WHICH_TO_SEND_THE_NOTIFICATIONS}

nvidia-clerk-windows.exe -region={REGION_CODE_HERE}
``` 

#### The log says "Access Denied" and then quits
This can be caused by a myriad of things. However, here's some items to check:
1. Is your antivirus blocking it? Some AVs will copy the threatening file into a separate directory and give a notification
2. Is your firewall blocking access?
3. Do you have the right permissions to run this program?

#### It's still not working... halp
